How was your Easter? 

With the world being in various stage of Lockdown, and everyone being at home, we thought it would be the opportune chance to show off some of the things that we are doing to rebuild a complete, outdated platform, from scratch. This has been a project of ours for almost a year now, and it's slowly coming along. 

To bring you up to speed, we've decided on the following technologies: 

* The new website will be written in Swift
* We will be using the Vapor framework
* The website will be completely responsive
* The website will have all our own code (with the exception of packages required by us, or by Vapor)

And so far, we think it looks pretty dapper, even if we do say so ourselves.

The new website is a cultivation of this website, which will also run on much the same design code, with small changes for the website it is running. We believe this to be paramount to the experience: Don't overcomplicate. It may well come back to bite you. 

We like developing all our code ourselves. It makes us feel... liberated, in a sense. We know exactly where everything is, and we know how it fits together. It's clean, it's accurate, and it's fast.
