    <h1>asperger media price list</h1>
</div>
<p>Asperger Media's pricing structure aims to be both cost-effective and predictable. Whilst we appreciate that some people may not be able to afford our prices, except in extremely rare circumstances, or where we have explicitly provided you with an offer, we do not provide discounts.</p>
<p>Asperger Media works on a 'Parts and Labour' basis. We generally provide a quote of work, and expect parts to be paid for, where necessary, before commencement of work. We will not charge you for labour until after the work has been completed. </p>
<p>Some of our prices are below; all prices are inclusive of 10% GST. If your product is not listed, feel free to get in touch with us, and we'll provide you with a no-obligation, completely free quote. </p>
